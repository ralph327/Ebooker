Ebooker
=======

Your way to abstract poetry stardom!

Ebooker is a service that will consume a corpus of text (usually a Twitter
stream) and generate new text based on a Markov model of randomization. This is
nothing new: most people speculate @horse\_ebooks came about this way, but I'm a
believer it's just Markov-assisted and not truly botty. Excellent examples of
Markov-based Twitter accounts are @kpich\_ebooks, @RandomTEDTalks, and
@MarkovBible.

Implemented in Go, because the gopher is cute and I was curious.
